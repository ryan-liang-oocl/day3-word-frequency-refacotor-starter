​	I learned about the concept of refactoring this morning. Starting from the code snippet and example code, I learned where to refactor from. At the same time, I also learned some specifications for refactoring. The granularity should not only be small, but the commit message should clearly show which aspect of refactoring has been carried out.

​	This afternoon, we mainly practiced refactoring. Then I continued to learn some related concepts of concept maps and drew concept maps based on the knowledge I learned in the past few days

​	Refactor a problematic code today. Because there are many issues with this code and there are many points that need to be improved, listing them one by one and then making changes would also take a very long time. Although it was tiring, I also gained a lot.
